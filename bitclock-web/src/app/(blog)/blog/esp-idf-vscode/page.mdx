Many electronics hobbyists begin with the Arduino ecosystem. That's how I got started!

My first project was a tripod mount that could hold an iPhone for filming and pan using a motor. Early iterations used an [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble), a [servo motor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BV5D7MD/), and 4x AA batteries.

When writing firmware for the Arduino Nano, I started with the Android IDE + SDK.

The code for communicating over Bluetooth and controlling the servo fit into a few hundred line `.ino` sketch file.
The wiring was pretty straightforward and only needed a few pins connected. The Arduino [Servo](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/)
library for motor control and [ArduinoBLE](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduinoble/) for comms made it easy to implement.

When I finished working on that project, I moved to increasingly complex projects. The [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) project
needed to connect to an e-ink screen, mount three I2C sensors, and fit into a tiny enclosure.
At this point, I was looking to graduate from the Arduino Nano and hand soldering everything together.

<InlineImage

/>

<GetBitclock />

To meet these requirements, I decided to design a custom PCB (printed circuit board).
By designing a PCB specific to the device, Bitclock electronics could have a smaller footprint that would fit snugly into an enclosure.
Additionally, manufacturing the product at scale would be simplified through PCB assembly services
like üá®üá≥ [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/), or üá∫üá∏ [MacroFab](https://www.macrofab.com/).

I should disclose that one of my main goals when starting [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) was to learn custom PCB design,
so my approach was going to end up there anyway!

<InlineImage
  src={BitclockPcbImage}
  alt="Bitclock PCB photo"
  label="Bitclock PCB assembly, featuring an ESP32-S3 microcontroller"
  priority
/>

An early question when designing [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) was which microcontroller to use.

I settled on the [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) module, which you can see mounted to the top-right corner of the PCB. These ESP32 SoC (system-on-a-chip) modules are popular for a few reasons:

- **All-in-one**: Built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and flash simplifies PCB design
- **Low price**: Modules starting at [~$1](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-C3-MINI-1-N4/13877574), dev boards for [~$10](https://www.amazon.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C3-Microcontroller/dp/B0B94JZ2YF/)
- **USB support**: Can be powered, flashed, and debugged over USB
- **SDK**: Extensive development framework with high quality [documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/index.html)
- **Low power**: Can operate in the 10s of mA, sleep in ¬µA range
- **Pre-certification**: [Pre-certified](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/certificates) by FCC and others making products easier to sell

With the [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) project, my firmware grew to [thousands of lines](https://github.com/goat-hill/bitclock/tree/master/bitclock-fw/main) and many files.
The firmware needed to render graphics for a display, communicate over bluetooth + Wi-Fi, communicate with sensors.
These features needed to multi-task on a single core and meet the constrained memory & flash of the ESP32.

While you can technically write code for ESP32 using the Arduino IDE + SDK, I settled on an alternative approach for this project
using Espressif's [**ESP-IDF framework**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

### Switching to ESP-IDF

Technically, you _can_ program an ESP32 using Arduino IDE & SDK.

The generic Arduino toolchain supports different hardware platforms through [**Arduino Cores**](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API).
Each Arduino Core implements the standard APIs like [Serial](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/) and [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/wire/).
In the case of ESP32 devices, Espressif
actively maintains the [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) core implementation.

Under the hood, the [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) core is largely implemented using the [**ESP-IDF framework**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).
The ESP-IDF framework was developed specifically for ESP32 SoCs, and has many features and APIs specific to that family of devices.

<InlineImage
  src={ArduinoCoreImage}
  alt="Demonstration of Arduino leveraging ESP-IDF"
  label="arduino-esp32 is implemented using ESP-IDF"
/>

This brought about a major design decision for [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io). Continue using the generic and familiar Arduino SDKs, or switch to the manufacturer's ESP-IDF framework?

- ‚úÖ Arduino is a familiar SDK
- ‚úÖ Arduino is compatible with different hardware
- ‚úÖ Arduino can be lower effort to bootstrap using the IDE
- ‚ùå Arduino core abstraction layer means more code. Extra code could lead to unnecessary complexity and bugs.
- ‚ùå Arduino cores cannot make ESP32-specific assumptions. This could make precise device control more difficult.

For the Bitclock project, hardware cross-compatibility was not a priority. Instead, hardware _control_ was more important especially given the hardware constraints of:

- 400kB memory
- 8 MB flash
- Single core to multi-task display + sensors + networking

On the other hand, the ESP-IDF framework offers equivalent [high and low level APIs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/index.html), and is very well documented.

Some of the ESP-IDF features Bitclock leverages include:

- [freertos](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/system/freertos.html) - Multi-threading for better display performance
- [ota](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/system/ota.html) - OTA firmware updates via Wi-Fi or bluetooth
- [partitions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html) - For custom layouts of flash memory
- [bt](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/bluetooth/index.html) - Bluetooth + BLE applications

Given the above, I decided to use ESP-IDF directly and bypass the Arduino abstraction.

### Switching to VSCode

While I had enjoyed using the Arduino IDE previously, it no longer seemed the obvious choice given the ESP-IDF choice. VSCode was the general code editor I used the most, and has many appealing features:

- Strong IDE support for [C and C++ development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- Performant and streamlined text editor
- As opposed to Arduino IDE: better support for files and directories
- Free. Corporate backing by Microsoft
- Integrates Github Copilot which can [speed up development](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/)

In order to make the switch to VSCode, it was necessary to ensure that I would have replacements for a few crucial Arduino IDE features:

1. Compile + flash + serial log monitoring
2. Static code analysis + code completion
3. Interactive GDB debugging

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a popular VSCode extension that supports all of these features, so I experimented with that before ultimately deciding not to use it and instead configure VSCode manually.

#### Evaluating PlatformIO

On paper, PlatformIO supported all the features I wanted for embedded development in VSCode. I'd be able to compile, flash, debug, and get static analysis of my code.

However, after installing the extension I was less enthused. I was greeted with a landing page showing news, social links, and project creation wizards. It's certainly a personal preference, but PlatformIO was delivering me an entire IDE-within-IDE when I was looking for a few basic debugging and code highlighting features.

<InlineImage
  src={PlatformioImage}
  alt="PlatformIO screenshot"
  label="VSCode after PlatformIO extension installed"
/>

Fortunately, there is an alternative way to get the functionality I desired using only VSCode, the [C/C++ extension by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools), and the [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) CLI toolchain.

### ESP-IDF toolchain setup

The ESP-IDF toolchain includes the SDK, as well as a [command line front-end](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-py.html) for `build`, `flash`, and `monitor`.
If you use PlatformIO it likely installs it for you, but since we're doing things manually we'll install it ourselves.

Follow the [instructions from Espressif here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html).

On macOS, you'll need create a directory to install the SDK to and the process goes something like this:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja dfu-util python3
git clone -b v5.3 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
./install.fish esp32s3
source export.sh
```

Make sure to read the [latest docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html) for up-to-date installation instructions.

### ESP-IDF project bootstrapping

With the toolchain now installed, create a separate directory to house the source code of your new project.

You can use ESP-IDF frontend to create a barebone project for you:

```sh
source ~/your/path/to/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py create-project example
```

This will create a directory structure with the following:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt          Top-level build configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt      Defines main build target + dependencies
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.c           Main run function for app
```

Make sure to tell ESP-IDF what device you are building for:

```sh
idf.py set-target esp32s3
```

With that complete, build and run is a simple via the CLI:

- `idf.py build`
- `idf.py flash`
- `idf.py monitor`

### Static analysis + code completion

The ESP-IDF CLI tool solves build + run, but for VSCode to be a real IDE‚Ñ¢Ô∏è it needs to know where to look for ESP-IDF libraries referenced by your code.

We'd need code static analysis to get library auto-completion, CMD+click to jump to function definitions, and a red squiggly underlines when we add a bug.

<InlineVideo
  src="/videos/vscode-completion.mp4"
  autoplay
  loop
  label="Auto-completion from ESP-IDF SDK"
/>

First, make sure you have the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) by Microsoft installed.

Then we can [configure IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/customize-default-settings-cpp) by adding a `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file to the root of the project. VSCode will read this to configure the extension.

Here's an example that worked for Bitclock's ESP32-S3 on macOS:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "esp-version": "esp-13.2.0_20240530"
  },
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "esp32s3",
      "compilerPath": "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/bin/xtensa-esp-elf-gcc",
      "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json",
      "includePath": [
        "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/xtensa-esp-elf/include/**",
        "${HOME}/code/esp-idf/components/**",
        "${workspaceFolder}/**"
      ],
      "browse": {
        "path": [
          "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/xtensa-esp-elf/include/**",
          "${HOME}/code/esp-idf/components/**",
          "${workspaceFolder}/**"
        ],
        "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "version": 4
}
```

It does the following:

- Sets `.compilerPath` to point to the GCC compiler used for the project
- Sets `.compileCommands` to hint to IntelliSense the specific arguments for how each file was last compiled
- Sets `.includePath` to include the core libraries for IntelliSense, [component](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html) libraries, and your project workspace
- Sets `.browse.path` to include same libraries for the ["Tag Parser" of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/faq-cpp#_what-is-the-difference-between-includepath-and-browsepath)

Make sure the paths match the locations of ESP-IDF's install location and `~/.espressif` workspace for your system. See the ESP-IDF [tools.json](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/tools.json) to see what version you should be pointing to. For example, ESP32-S3 uses the `xtensa-esp-elf` compiler while ESP32-C3 uses `riscv32-esp-elf`.

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how critical each of these fields is to IntelliSense but I do know that in its entirety the configuration worked for my project!
I used the [Espressif's VSCode extension](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/C_CPP_CONFIGURATION.md) as a guide (yet another VSCode extension that I opted to skip and configure manually üßò).

### Interactive debugging

Last but not least, we'd like to have GDB functionality within VSCode. The `C/C++` extension we've already installed supports this but we need to tell it how to connect.

<InlineVideo
  src="/videos/vscode-debug.mp4"
  autoplay
  loop
  label="ESP32 interactive debugging using OpenOCD"
/>

For Bitclock, the following [debugging configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference) worked by this file to your project's `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "esp-openocd",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/example.elf",
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "/full/path/to/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf-gdb/14.2_20240403/xtensa-esp-elf-gdb/bin/xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gdb",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "setupCommands": [
        { "text": "target extended-remote :3333" },
        { "text": "set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2" },
        { "text": "mon reset halt" },
        { "text": "maintenance flush register-cache" },
        { "text": "thb app_main" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure `.miDebuggerPath` points to the correct ESP-IDF toolchain for this project (see `tools.json` tip from above). Also ensure `.program` points to the `.elf` build of your project.

Once setup, connect your ESP32 hardware, flash it with the latest version of your app, and start the local [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/) server. This will start a debugging connection over USB with your device:

```sh
idf.py openocd
```

The last step is to connect VSCode to your debugging session. Open the **Run & Debug Panel** (on macOS: <Kbd>‚åò</Kbd> + <Kbd>Shift</Kbd> + <Kbd>D</Kbd>), then the click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button to start debugging (<Kbd>F5</Kbd>).
VSCode allows you to visually set breakpoints, inspect memory, and the usual debugging IDE features you'd expect.

### Parting thoughts

For projects that grow too complex for the Arduino ecosystem, consider switching to ESP-IDF & VSCode.
If you take that path, I hope this write-up proves a helpful resource in getting things going.
