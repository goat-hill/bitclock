Many electronics hobbyists begin with the Arduino ecosystem. That's how I got started!

My first project was a tripod mount that could hold an iPhone for filming and pan using a motor. Early iterations used an [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble), a [servo motor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BV5D7MD/), and 4x AA batteries.

When writing firmware for the Arduino Nano, I started with the Android IDE + SDK.

The code for communicating over Bluetooth and controlling the servo fit into a few hundred line `.ino` sketch file.
The wiring was pretty straightforward and only needed a few pins connected. The Arduino [Servo](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/)
library for motor control and [ArduinoBLE](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduinoble/) for comms made it easy to implement.

When I finished working on that project, I moved to increasingly complex projects. The [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) project
needed to connect to an e-ink screen, mount three I2C sensors, and fit into a tiny enclosure.
At this point, I was looking to graduate from the Arduino Nano and hand soldering everything together.

<InlineImage

  alt="Bitclock photo"
  label="Bitclock - E-ink clock + air quality monitor"
/>

To meet these requirements I decided to design a custom PCB (printed circuit board).
By designing a PCB specific to the device, Bitclock electronics could have a smaller footprint that would fit snugly into an enclosure.
Additionally, manufacturing the product at scale would be simplified through PCB assembly services
like 🇨🇳 [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/), or 🇺🇸 [MacroFab](https://www.macrofab.com/).

I should disclose that one of my main goals when starting [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) was to learn custom PCB design,
so my approach was going to end up there anyway!

<InlineImage
  src={BitclockPcbImage}
  alt="Bitclock PCB photo"
  label="Bitclock PCB assembly, featuring an ESP32-S3 microcontroller"
  priority
/>

An early question when designing [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) was which microcontroller to use.

I settled on the [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) module, which you can see mounted to the top-right corner of the PCB. These ESP32 SoC (system-on-a-chip) modules are popular for a few reasons:

- **All-in-one**: Built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and flash simplifies PCB design
- **Low price**: Modules starting at [~$1](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-C3-MINI-1-N4/13877574), dev boards for [~$10](https://www.amazon.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C3-Microcontroller/dp/B0B94JZ2YF/)
- **USB support**: Can be powered, flashed, and debugged over USB
- **SDK**: Extensive development framework with high quality [documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/index.html)
- **Low power**: Can operate in the 10s of mA, sleep in µA range
- **Pre-certification**: [Pre-certified](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/certificates) by FCC and others making products easier to sell

With the [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io) project, my firmware grew to thousands of lines and many files.
The firmware needed to render graphics for a display, communicate over bluetooth + Wi-Fi, communicate with sensors.
These features needed to multi-task on a single core and meet the constrained memory & flash of the ESP32.

While you can technically write code for ESP32 using the Arduino IDE + SDK, I settled an alternative approach for this project
using Espressif's [**ESP-IDF framework**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

### Switching to ESP-IDF

Technically, you *can* program an ESP32 using Arduino IDE & SDK.

The generic Arduino toolchain supports different hardware platforms through [**Arduino Cores**](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API).
Each Arduino Core implements the standard APIs like [Serial](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/) and [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/wire/).
In the case of ESP32 devices, Espressif
actively maintains the [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) core implementation.

Under the hood, the [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) core is largely implemented using the [**ESP-IDF framework**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).
The ESP-IDF framework was developed specifically for ESP32 SoCs, and has many features and APIs specific to that family of devices.

<InlineImage
  src={ArduinoCoreImage}
  alt="Demonstration of Arduino leveraging ESP-IDF"
  label="arduino-esp32 is implemented using ESP-IDF"
/>

This brought about a major design decision for [Bitclock](https://bitclock.io). Continue using the generic and familiar Arduino SDKs, or switch to the manufacturer's ESP-IDF framework?

- ✅ Arduino is a familiar SDK
- ✅ Arduino is compatible with different hardware
- ✅ Arduino can be lower effort to bootstrap using the IDE
- ❌ Arduino core abstraction layer means more code. Extra code could lead to unnecessary complexity and bugs.
- ❌ Arduino cores cannot make ESP32-specific assumptions. This could precise device control more difficult.

For the Bitclock project, hardware cross-compatibility was not a priority. Instead, hardware _control_ was more important especially given the hardware constraints of:

- 400kB memory
- 8 MB flash
- Single core to multi-task display + sensors + networking

On the other hand, the ESP-IDF framework offers equivalent [high and low level APIs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/index.html), and is very well documented.

Some of the ESP-IDF features Bitclock leverages include:

- [freertos](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/system/freertos.html) - Multi-threading for better display performance
- [ota](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/system/ota.html) - OTA firmware updates via Wi-Fi or bluetooth
- [partitions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html) - For custom layouts of flash memory
- [bt](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/bluetooth/index.html) - Bluetooth + BLE applications

Given the above, I decided to use ESP-IDF directly and bypass the Arduino abstraction.

### Switching to VSCode

While I had enjoyed using the Arduino IDE previously, it no longer seemed the obvious choice given the ESP-IDF choice. VSCode was the general code editor I used the most, and has many appealing features:

- Strong IDE support for [C and C++ development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- Performant and streamlined text editor
- As opposed to Arduino IDE: better support for files and directories
- Free. Corporate backing by Microsoft
- Integrates Github Copilot which can [speed up development](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/)

In order to make the switch to VSCode, it was necessary to ensure that I would have replacements for a few crucial Arduino IDE features:

1. Compile + flash + serial log monitoring
2. Static code analysis + code completion
3. Interactive GDB debugging

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a popular VSCode extension that supports all of these features, so I experimented with that before ultimately deciding not to use it and instead configure VSCode manually.

#### Evaluating PlatformIO

On paper, PlatformIO supported all the features I wanted for embedded development in VSCode. I'd be able to compile, flash, debug, and get static analysis of my code.

However, after installing the extension I was less enthused. I was greeted with a landing page showing news, social links, and project creation wizards. It's certainly a personal preference, but PlatformIO was delivering me an entire IDE-within-IDE when I was looking for a few basic features.

<InlineImage
  src={PlatformioImage}
  alt="PlatformIO screenshot"
  label="VSCode after PlatformIO extension installed"
/>

Fortunately, there is an alternative way to get the functionality I desired using only VSCode, the [C/C++ extension by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools), and the [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) CLI toolchain.

### ESP-IDF toolchain setup

In order to start developing with ESP-IDF, you'll first need to install the toolchain. Follow the [instructions from Espressif here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html).

On macOS, you'll need create a directory to install the SDK to and the process goes something like this:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja dfu-util python@3.12 openssl
git clone -b v5.2.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
./install.fish esp32s3
source export.sh
```

Make sure to select the latest release version of ESP-IDF, the board you are using in place of `esp32s3` and read their docs for the latest instructions.

### ESP-IDF project bootstrapping

With the toolchain now installed, create a separate directory to house the source code of your new project.

See the [ESP-IDF Hello World](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.2.2/examples/get-started/hello_world) example for the basic project setup.

The file structure will start with the following:

```text
├── CMakeLists.txt          Top-level build configuration
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt      Defines main build target + dependencies
│   └── hello_world_main.c
```

Once your project is created, and the ESP-IDF environment is active via `source ~/esp-idf/export.sh`, build and run is a simple via the CLI:

- `idf.py build`
- `idf.py flash`
- `idf.py monitor`

The [Hello World example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.2.2/examples/get-started/hello_world) does a good job of giving the basics of how an ESP-IDF project and the contents of CMakeLists.txt, so this post will focus on other topics.

### Static analysis + code completion

If you want VSCode to be helpful with auto-completions, and be able to cmd+click to jump to function definitions from the SDK, there's a bit more setup to get hat working.

Specifically, you need the VSCode [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) installed from Microsoft and [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/customize-default-settings-cpp) properly configured for ESP-IDF.

<InlineVideo
  src="/videos/vscode-completion.mp4"
  autoplay
  loop
  label="Auto-completion from ESP-IDF SDK"
/>

IntelliSense can be configured by adding a `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` to the root of your project directory. VSCode will read this file to configure the IDE to your project.

Here's an example that worked for Bitclock's ESP32-S3:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "esp-version": "esp-13.2.0_20240530"
  },
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "esp32s3",
      "compilerPath": "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/bin/xtensa-esp-elf-gcc",
      "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json",
      "includePath": [
        "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/xtensa-esp-elf/include/**",
        "${HOME}/code/esp-idf/components/**",
        "${workspaceFolder}/**"
      ],
      "browse": {
        "path": [
          "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/xtensa-esp-elf/include/**",
          "${HOME}/code/esp-idf/components/**",
          "${workspaceFolder}/**"
        ],
        "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "version": 4
}
```

It does the following:

- Sets `.compilerPath` to point to the GCC compiler used for the project
- Sets `.compileCommands` to hint to IntelliSense the specific arguments for how each file was last compiled
- Sets `.includePath` to include the core libraries for IntelliSense, [component](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html) libraries, and your project workspace
- Sets `.browse.path` to include same libraries for the ["Tag Parser" of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/faq-cpp#_what-is-the-difference-between-includepath-and-browsepath)

Make sure the compiler path matches your environment. See the ESP-IDF [tools.json](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/tools.json) to see what version you should be pointing to. For example, ESP32-S3 uses the `extensa-esp-elf` compiler while ESP32-C3 uses `riscv32-esp-elf`.

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how each of these arugments impacts VSCode but I do know that in its entirety the configuration worked for my project!
This configuration was [inspired by Espressif's VSCode extension](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/C_CPP_CONFIGURATION.md)
I evaluated using extension directly but had more luck configuring things myself and avoiding yet-another-extension.

### Interactive debugging

No IDE is complete without interactive debugging! Luckily, this was also possible with just a bit of configuration.

<InlineVideo
  src="/videos/vscode-debug.mp4"
  autoplay
  loop
  label="GDB interactive debugging using OpenOCD"
/>

First, add something like the following configuration to your `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "esp-openocd",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/bitclock.elf",
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "/Users/bradylaw/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf-gdb/14.2_20240403/xtensa-esp-elf-gdb/bin/xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gdb",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "setupCommands": [
        { "text": "target extended-remote :3333" },
        { "text": "set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2" },
        { "text": "mon reset halt" },
        { "text": "maintenance flush register-cache" },
        { "text": "thb app_main" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure `.miDebuggerPath` points to your locally installed ESP-IDF toolchain and the appropriate debugger for your hardware. See the ESP-IDF [tools.json](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/tools.json) to see what version you should be pointing to.

First, connect your ESP32 device that is flashed with your app, and start the local openOCD server

```sh
idf.py openocd
```

TODO: Show how to attach in VSCode, set breakpoints, print values.

### Parting thoughts

In this post, we outlined how to set up a development environment for an ESP32 project using ESP-IDF and VSCode instead of the more restrictive Arduino IDE.

In future posts we'll go into:

- Multi-threaded apps with freertos
- Working with e-ink displays and LVGL graphics
- Designing custom PCBs to fit 3D printed enclosures

In the meantime, send any comments or development tips to brady@bitclock.io!

Also if you're interested in a cute desk clock + air quality monitor for your desk that inspired this post, order one at [bitclock.io](https://bitclock.io).
It's completely open source and a fun hackable device to get started with ESP32 development.
