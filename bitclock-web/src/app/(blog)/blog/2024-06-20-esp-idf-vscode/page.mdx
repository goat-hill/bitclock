Many hobbyist electronics projects, including [Bitclock](https://github.com/goat-hill/bitclock), use ESP32 modules to power their devices.

These SoC (system-on-a-chip) components are popular for a variety of reasons:

- **Simplicity**: Built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, antenna and flash
- **Low price**: Modules for [~$1](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-C3-MINI-1-N4/13877574), dev boards for [~$10](https://www.amazon.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C3-Microcontroller/dp/B0B94JZ2YF/)
- **SDK**: Extensive development framework and high quality [documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/index.html)
- **Low power consumption**: Can operate in the 10s of mA or sleep in µA
- **Pre-certification**: [Pre-certified](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/certificates) by FCC and others so it's easier to sell

When starting these projects, developers may be drawn to the familiar Arduino SDK. However, as projects grow in complexity the Arduino ecosystem may no longer be the best choice.

In this post, I'll outline a more advanced firmware development setup using the Espressif **ESP-IDF SDK**, alongside **VSCode** as the IDE. This setup has proven effective for the [Bitclock](https://github.com/goat-hill/bitclock) open-source project.

### Arduino vs ESP-IDF

#### Arduino abstraction adds complexity, limits control

For a simple embedded app like a blinking LED, the Arduino SDK is a popular way to bootstrap projects.
The generic SDK allows code to be hardware-agnostic, or at least partially.
This is made possible through hardware-specific ports known as **Arduino Cores**.

Each Arduino Core implements the core-level APIs of Arduino for their respective hardware platforms. In the case of ESP32 devices, Espressif
maintains the [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) core implementation.

An alternative to using the Arduino SDK is the [**ESP-IDF framework**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), developed by Espressif specifically for their ESP32 chips.
Notably, the [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) core
uses ESP-IDF under the hood and is an abstraction layer on top.

So what's are the tradeoffs of using Arduino instead of ESP-IDF directly?

- ✅ Arduino is a familiar SDK
- ✅ Arduino is compatible with different hardware
- ✅ Arduino can be lower effort to bootstrap using the IDE
- ❌ Arduino core abstraction layer means more code, complexity, and room for bugs
- ❌ Arduino core APIs cannot make ESP32 assumptions, making hardware optimization more complex

For the Bitclock project, hardware cross-compatibility was not a priority. Instead, hardware _control_ was more important especially given the hardware constraints of:

- 400kB memory
- 8 MB flash
- Single core to multi-task display + sensors + networking

On the other hand, the ESP-IDF framework offers equivalent [high and low level APIs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/index.html), and is very well documented.

Some of the ESP-IDF features Bitclock leverages include:

- [freertos](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/system/freertos.html) - Multi-threading for better display performance
- [ota](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/system/ota.html) - OTA firmware updates via Wi-Fi or bluetooth
- [partitions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html) - For custom layouts of flash memory
- [bt](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/bluetooth/index.html) - Bluetooth + BLE applications

Given this, the decision was made to use ESP-IDF directly and bypass the Arduino abstraction.

#### Graduating from Arduino IDE to VSCode

With the SDK decision settled for Bitclock, there was an open question about the IDE choice.

Previous embedded projects I worked on used the Arduino IDE, but that no longer seemed the best option given the ESP-IDF choice. VSCode was the editor I use for most other programming projects, and has many appealing features:

- Strong IDE support for [C and C++ development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- Performant editor not bloated with features
- Better support for files and directories (as opposed to Arduino IDE)
- Free + corporate backing by Microsoft
- Integrates Github Copilot which can [speed up development](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/)

In order to make the switch to VSCode, it was necessary to ensure that in VSCode I could keep a few core developer features of the Arduino IDE:

1. **Compile + flash + serial log monitoring**
2. **Static code analysis + code completion**
3. **Interactive GDB debugging**

It turns out this is all possible within VSCode, but does require a bit more setup work, which I will outline in the remainder of this post.

#### Evaluating PlatformIO

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a popular VSCode extension for ESP32 development within VSCode.
While it is a functional solution for ESP-IDF development, I ultimately chose against using it.

My first impression after install that it felt like installing a bloated IDE within VSCode, as opposed to being a precise tool for the specific functionality needed like build + run + debug.

<InlineImage
  src={PlatformioImage}
  alt="PlatformIO screenshot"
  label="VSCode after PlatformIO extension installed"
/>

PlatformIO just felt a bit heavy-weight for my preference and perhaps triggered some past trauma of working with larger IDEs like Eclipse & Xcode.

Fortunately, there is an alternative way to get the functionality I desired using only VSCode, the [C/C++ extension by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools), and the [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) toolchain.

### ESP-IDF toolchain setup

In order to start developing with ESP-IDF, you'll first need to install the toolchain. Follow the [instructions from Espressif here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html).

On macOS, you'll need create a directory to install the SDK to and the process goes something like this:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja dfu-util python@3.12 openssl
git clone -b v5.2.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
./install.fish esp32s3
source export.sh
```

Make sure to select the latest release version of ESP-IDF, the board you are using in place of `esp32s3` and read their docs for the latest instructions.

### ESP-IDF project bootstrapping

With the toolchain now installed, create a separate directory to house the source code of your new project.

See the [ESP-IDF Hello World](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.2.2/examples/get-started/hello_world) example for the basic project setup.

The file structure will start with the following:

```text
├── CMakeLists.txt          Top-level build configuration
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt      Defines main build target + dependencies
│   └── hello_world_main.c
```

Once your project is created, and the ESP-IDF environment is active via `source ~/esp-idf/export.sh`, build and run is a simple via the CLI:

- `idf.py build`
- `idf.py flash`
- `idf.py monitor`

The [Hello World example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.2.2/examples/get-started/hello_world) does a good job of giving the basics of how an ESP-IDF project and the contents of CMakeLists.txt, so this post will focus on other topics.

### Static analysis + code completion

If you want VSCode to be helpful with auto-completions, and be able to cmd+click to jump to function definitions from the SDK, there's a bit more setup to get hat working.

Specifically, you need the VSCode [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) installed from Microsoft and [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/customize-default-settings-cpp) properly configured for ESP-IDF.

<InlineVideo

  autoplay
  loop
  label="Auto-completion from ESP-IDF SDK"
/>

IntelliSense can be configured by adding a `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` to the root of your project directory. VSCode will read this file to configure the IDE to your project.

Here's an example that worked for Bitclock's ESP32-S3:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "esp-version": "esp-13.2.0_20240530"
  },
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "esp32s3",
      "compilerPath": "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/bin/xtensa-esp-elf-gcc",
      "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json",
      "includePath": [
        "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/xtensa-esp-elf/include/**",
        "${HOME}/code/esp-idf/components/**",
        "${workspaceFolder}/**"
      ],
      "browse": {
        "path": [
          "${HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf/${esp-version}/xtensa-esp-elf/xtensa-esp-elf/include/**",
          "${HOME}/code/esp-idf/components/**",
          "${workspaceFolder}/**"
        ],
        "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "version": 4
}
```

It does the following:

- Sets `.compilerPath` to point to the GCC compiler used for the project
- Sets `.compileCommands` to hint to IntelliSense the specific arguments for how each file was last compiled
- Sets `.includePath` to include the core libraries for IntelliSense, [component](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html) libraries, and your project workspace
- Sets `.browse.path` to include same libraries for the ["Tag Parser" of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/faq-cpp#_what-is-the-difference-between-includepath-and-browsepath)

Make sure the compiler path matches your environment. See the ESP-IDF [tools.json](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/tools.json) to see what version you should be pointing to. For example, ESP32-S3 uses the `extensa-esp-elf` compiler while ESP32-C3 uses `riscv32-esp-elf`.

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how each of these arugments impacts VSCode but I do know that in its entirety the configuration worked for my project!
This configuration was [inspired by Espressif's VSCode extension](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/C_CPP_CONFIGURATION.md)
I evaluated using extension directly but had more luck configuring things myself and avoiding yet-another-extension.

### Interactive debugging

No IDE is complete without interactive debugging! Luckily, this was also possible with just a bit of configuration.

<InlineVideo

  label="GDB interactive debugging using OpenOCD"
/>

First, add something like the following configuration to your `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "esp-openocd",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/bitclock.elf",
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "/Users/bradylaw/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp-elf-gdb/14.2_20240403/xtensa-esp-elf-gdb/bin/xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gdb",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "setupCommands": [
        { "text": "target extended-remote :3333" },
        { "text": "set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2" },
        { "text": "mon reset halt" },
        { "text": "maintenance flush register-cache" },
        { "text": "thb app_main" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure `.miDebuggerPath` points to your locally installed ESP-IDF toolchain and the appropriate debugger for your hardware. See the ESP-IDF [tools.json](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/tools.json) to see what version you should be pointing to.

First, connect your ESP32 device that is flashed with your app, and start the local openOCD server

```sh
idf.py openocd
```

TODO: Show how to attach in VSCode, set breakpoints, print values.

### Parting thoughts

In this post, we outlined how to set up a development environment for an ESP32 project using ESP-IDF and VSCode instead of the more restrictive Arduino IDE.

In future posts we'll go into:

- Multi-threaded apps with freertos
- Working with e-ink displays and LVGL graphics
- Designing custom PCBs to fit 3D printed enclosures

In the meantime, send any comments or development tips to brady@bitclock.io!
